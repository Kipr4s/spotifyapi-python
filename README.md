Connect your spotify api to python to get all information about the song and display it on pygame screen

Import all libs (pygame, spotipy, urllib.request, datetime, time, PIL, requests)

go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and create an app 
Then u have created an app go in to the setting on the right top corner
